The point system is divided into Standard Questions, Steals, and Daily Doubles: 


For a Standard Question, a correct answer awards the full dollar value, while an incorrect answer or running out of time deducts half the value and triggers a 5-second Steal opportunity for the opposing team, which, if successful, awards them half the original value (otherwise, no further points are lost). The Daily Double requires the team to first wager points (up to their score or $1000, whichever is higher), and they either win or lose the full wager amount depending on if they answer correctly or incorrectly; note that no team's score can ever drop below $0.
